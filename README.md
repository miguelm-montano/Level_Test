We implement part of the logic for a Steam videogame catalog.

👾 Each videogame has:

- Name
- Genre (Sport, RPG, FPS, Platform). A videogame can have multiple genres
- Number of players
- Player mode

🕹️ What we need?

Register at least 4 videogames.

Create a logic that returns the average price of all videogames.

Create another logic that, given a genre, returns the videogames of that genre.
